Add support for value ``max`` to ``NUMBA_OPT``.
===============================================

The optimisation level that Numba applies when compiling can be set through the
environment variable ``NUMBA_OPT``. This has historically been a value between
0 and 3 (inclusive). Support for the value ``max`` has now been added, this is a
Numba-specific optimisation level which will result in Numba running a -O3-like
optimistion before reference counting operations are pruned and then running
another -O3-like optimisation afterwards. This may or may not benefit the
run-time or compile-time performance of user code, but it has been added as it
is similar to the compilation behaviour prior to Numba 0.54 and some users found
it leads to better performance for their programs.
