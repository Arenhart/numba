Fix towncrier
=============

Pin ``towncrier`` to ``23.6`` and ``importlib_resources`` to ``<6``. Newer
``importlib_resources`` removed API used by ``towncrier``. The pinning can be 
removed once newer version of ``towncrier`` is released.
(The upstream patch is https://github.com/twisted/towncrier/pull/529)
