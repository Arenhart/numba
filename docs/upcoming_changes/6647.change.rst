Support for ``@intrinsic(prefer_literal=True)``
===============================================

This PR adds ``prefer_literal`` option for the ``intrinsic`` decorator to 
prioritize the use of literal types when available. This has the same 
behavior as in the ``prefer_literal`` option in the ``overload`` decorator.
