Refactor and remove legacy APIs/testing internals.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A number of internally used functions have been removed to aid with general
maintenance by reducing the number of ways in which it is possible to invoke
compilation, specifically:

* ``numba.core.compiler.compile_isolated`` is removed.
* ``numba.tests.support.TestCase::run_nullary_func`` is removed.
* ``numba.tests.support.CompilationCache`` is removed.
* "nested context" as a concept is removed from
  ``numba.core.registry.CPUTarget`` along with the implementation details.

Further, a bug was discovered, during the refactoring, in the typing of record
arrays. It materialised that two record types that only differed in their
mutability could alias, this has now been fixed.
